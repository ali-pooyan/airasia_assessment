YES,A thread is the unit of execution within a process. A process can have anywhere from just one thread to many threads.
When a process starts, it is assigned memory and resources. Each thread in the process shares that memory and resources. In single-threaded processes, the process contains one thread. The process and the thread are one and the same, and there is only one thing happening.
