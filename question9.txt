Overriding function is the definition under which function of the child class overrides the function of the base class which has the same name. That is only possible in different classes while Overloading is the ability to define functions of the same name, as long as they have different signatures.
Example of overriding:
class Animal:
  # properties
	multicellular = True
	# Eukaryotic means Cells with Nucleus
	eukaryotic = True
	
	# function breath
	def breathe(self):
	    print("I breathe oxygen.")
    
  # function feed
	def feed(self):
	    print("I eat food.")
	    
# child class	    
class Herbivorous(Animal):
    
    # function feed
	def feed(self):
	    print("I eat only plants. I am vegetarian.")

herbi = Herbivorous()
herbi.feed()
# calling some other function
herbi.breathe()

Example of overloading

# class
class Compute:
# area method
def area(self, x = None, y = None):
if x != None and y != None:
return x * y
elif x != None:
return x * x
else:
return 0
# object
obj = Compute()
# zero argument
print("Area Value:", obj.area())
# one argument
print("Area Value:", obj.area(4))
# two argument
print("Area Value:", obj.area(3, 5))
