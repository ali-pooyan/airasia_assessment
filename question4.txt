a = inheritance feature in object oriented programming is not consider becasue in Animal class if we add one method such as crawl we couldn't consider in other child class 
b = should be have one more inital method in animal class and after that whole obejct should be check in others class that will be extend in animal class 
should be change like that:


abstract class Animal {


function initial(self):
self object1= object1
self object2=object2 
.
.
.
.      
}    
class Bird extends Animal {
if self.animal==True :
print (self.animal)
}
else : 
print(“Not supported”)
